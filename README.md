# Hangman

##### The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player selects a letter which occurs in the word, the letter will appear on the dashes. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

##### The player guessing the word may, at any time attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the player wins. Otherwise, if the the player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the hangman to be displayed, the game is over. However, the player can also win by guessing all the letters that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the hangman is completed.
